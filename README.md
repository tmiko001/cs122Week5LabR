# Lab Week 05 Wed/Thurs

This lab, you'll be setting up the RGB TFT Screen.

### Required Compoenents
1. 1x FPGA (either ICESugar or ICESugar-pro)
1. 1x RGB Screen
2. 1x Ribbon-cable to PMOD Adapter

### Wiring
You will be using one of the 30-pin PMOD connectors to hook up the RGB LCD to your FPGA. We recommend using P6.

Don't forget to use the ribbon-cable to PMOD adapter.

## System Description
```verilog
module top
(
  input  CLK, //FPGA's clocck

	output LCD_CLK,//LCD clock. 
	output LCD_DEN,
	output [4:0] LCD_R,
	output [5:0] LCD_G,
	output [4:0] LCD_B,
);

```

You will be displaying three colors on the RGB screen. 1/3 of the screen should be red. Another 1/3 of the screen should be blue, and the another 1/3 should be green.

Reference BACKGROUND.md for an explanation on how the RGB Screen works.
